I'm Robin! I'm a health economist and currently finishing up my PhD in clinical informatics. My thesis focuses on the interaction between acute care providers (doctors and nurses) and clinical prediction models. I am really interested in further collaboration in this space so drop me an email or a message on linkedin if you want to talk about it. I frequently travel between Brisbane and Wellington, New Zealand.

I set up this site to share my research and to keep a to-do list of some of the project ideas that are currently interesting to me. My socials and research accounts, along with a few of my selected publications, can be found below.
